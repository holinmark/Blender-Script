# Blender-script
X file exporter for blender.

It's an x file exporter for blender 2.79b. Any other version of blender may not work.
It exports to a file named
"Blender_Export.txt"
to your documents folder.
Warning script will remove white spaces in the names of the armatures and meshes
and print them to the x file.


Must does:
1) Clean up code :) cause it looks messy.
